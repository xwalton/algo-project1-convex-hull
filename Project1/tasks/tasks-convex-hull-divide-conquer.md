## Relevant Files

- `convex_hull.py` - Main implementation file containing the divide and conquer convex hull algorithm
- `convex_hull_test.py` - Unit tests for the convex hull implementation
- `point.py` - Point dataclass definition for representing 2D points
- `point_test.py` - Unit tests for the Point class
- `input.csv` - Input file containing points (already exists)
- `output.txt` - Output file for hull point indices (generated by program)
- `DisplaySolution.py` - Visualization helper (already exists)
- `project1.sh` - Bash script for running the solution (already exists)

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `python3 -m pytest` to run tests
- The algorithm must achieve O(n log n) complexity using divide and conquer approach
- Input points are pre-sorted by x-coordinate, simplifying the implementation
